According to these lists of highly ranked terms, we can easily get that the important concepts of week1 are “pivot_length_normal”, “document_length_normal”, and “vector_space_model”. And “mean_reciprocal_rank” is the most important term for week2. To make the 
analysis better, we can ignore some common words. In other words, we should only keep academic term. Besides, we the order of words 
should be ignore in some cases. For example, I notice that “mean_reciproc_rank”, “reciproc_rank_mean”, and “rank_mean_reciproc” 
show up in week2 trigram. These three terms represent same thing. It would be better we count them as one academic term.
