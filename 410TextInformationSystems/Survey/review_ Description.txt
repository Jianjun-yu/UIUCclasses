[Text Mining for Business Intelligence] (Hao Wang, haow4; Shuo Feng, sfeng15)We will review research papers on text mining for business intelligence. More specific, we will focus on phrase embeddings. Here are a few examples of papers that we plan to read: 1) Yu, Mo, and Mark Dredze. "Learning composition models for phrase embeddings." Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics 3 (2015): 227-242.2) Liu, Jialu, et al. "Mining quality phrases from massive text corpora." Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data. ACM, 2015.3) Yin, Wenpeng, and Hinrich Schütze. "Discriminative phrase embedding for paraphrase identification." arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.00503 (2016).4) Yin, Wenpeng, and Hinrich Schütze. "An Exploration of Embeddings for Generalized Phrases." ACL (Student Research Workshop). 2014.
